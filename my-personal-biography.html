<p> Being a mastermind has become my part-time job since high school 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️. I just love to plan everything for our gathering, short-vacay, birthday parties and many more. When everything running as planned, I just feel blessed because everyone can met their long-lost friends. have a catch-up session with each others and gossiping is a must 😂😂. and yeah we can take a lot of pictures to keep as memories because we don't know when we can gather like this again 😢💔 </p>

<p> Secondly, I think i always be a good listener to my friends😆😆. If they have any problems or need someone to talk, they always find me to express what they feel or get my opinion even they know that i'm not a good advicer 😂.  maybe they,re feel comfortable to share with me 🙈🙈. </p>

<p>Last but not least, i love to travel. The latest place i go before this pandemic is Malacca. it's because my friend and me want to experience walk at the shore sky tower which is the tallest building at Malacca. We were fortunate enough to see the sunset as soon as we hit the top 🎴🎴.The scenery is magnificent. MashaAllah 💕 . We hope that when this pandemic come to the end, we can visit another beautiful places together 🥰🥰.  </p>
